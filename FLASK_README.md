## Quick Start (Railway Deployment)

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Ensure you have these files in your repository:

- `app.py` (Flask webhook server)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
- `.env.example` (Environment variable template)

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Fork/Clone this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Create Railway account** at [railway.app](https://railway.app)

3. **Deploy from GitHub**:

   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your forked repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python app and deploy

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - In Railway dashboard, go to "Variables" tab
   - Add your credentials from `.env.example`:
     ```
     GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
     GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here
     DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
     DISCORD_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
     ```

5. **Get Your Webhook URL**:
   - Copy your Railway app URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
   - Your webhook endpoint will be: `https://your-app.railway.app/webhook`

### 3. Setup GitHub Webhook

1. Go to your target repository settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks** ‚Üí **Add webhook**
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/webhook`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Your `WEBHOOK_SECRET` from Railway variables
   - **Events**: Select "Pull requests" only
   - **Active**: ‚úÖ Checked

### 4. Test Your Setup

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/` to verify the server is running
2. **Manual Test**: Use the test endpoint with a POST request to `/test`
3. **Live Test**: Create a test PR in your repository to see the webhook in action

That's it! Your PR bot is now live and will automatically analyze PRs and send notifications to Discord.

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run development server
python app.py
```

```

### 3. Railway Deployment

Railway automatically detects Python applications and handles deployment seamlessly.

#### Step-by-Step Railway Deployment:

1. **Create Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)

2. **Connect GitHub Repository**:

   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your GitHub PR Bot repository

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Click on "Variables" tab
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
     GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here
     DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
     DISCORD_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
     ```

4. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically detect `requirements.txt`
   - It will install dependencies and start your Flask app
   - Your app will be available at `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

#### Railway Configuration:

Railway automatically:

- Detects Python and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Runs your Flask app using `python app.py`
- Provides HTTPS URLs for webhooks
- Handles scaling and health checks
- Offers built-in monitoring and logs

#### Custom Start Command (Optional):

If you need a custom start command, create a `railway.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app"
```

## Security Configuration

### Webhook Secret Setup

1. Generate a secure random string:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

2. Add to your `.env` file:

```env
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

3. Configure the same secret in your GitHub webhook settings

### GitHub Token Permissions

Your GitHub Personal Access Token needs these scopes:

- `repo` (for private repositories) OR `public_repo` (for public repositories)
- `pull_requests:read`
- `issues:read` (for PR discussions)

### Environment Security

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate tokens and secrets regularly
- Use HTTPS for webhook URLs

## Monitoring and Logging

Railway provides built-in monitoring and logging:

### Viewing Logs in Railway:

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Select your active deployment
4. View real-time logs and metrics

### Log Levels

- `INFO`: Normal operations, PR processing
- `WARNING`: Missing optional data, fallback behaviors
- `ERROR`: Failed API calls, Discord delivery failures
- `DEBUG`: Detailed request/response data (development only)

### Railway Monitoring Features:

- **CPU/Memory Usage**: Monitor resource consumption
- **Request Metrics**: Track webhook requests and response times
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic error detection and alerting
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Webhook not receiving events**

- Check webhook URL is accessible (use tools like ngrok for local testing)
- Verify GitHub webhook configuration
- Check webhook secret matches

**2. Discord messages not sending**

- Verify Discord webhook URL is correct
- Check Discord server permissions
- Ensure webhook URL hasn't expired

**3. GitHub API errors**

- Verify GitHub token has required permissions
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure repository access

**4. Groq API failures**

- Verify API key is valid
- Check Groq service status
- Monitor token usage/limits

### Testing Your Railway Deployment

**Health Check:**

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/
```

**Manual PR Testing:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/test \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"owner": "username", "repo": "repository", "pr_number": 123}'
```

**View Railway Logs:**

- Go to your Railway project dashboard
- Click on "Deployments" tab
- Click on the latest deployment to view logs
- Monitor webhook events and any errors

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Event Filtering

Modify the `process_pr_event` function to handle additional events:

```python
# Skip certain actions
skip_actions = ['assigned', 'unassigned', 'labeled', 'unlabeled']

# Add custom logic for specific actions
if action == 'review_requested':
    # Custom handling for review requests
    pass
```

### Summary Customization

Adjust the Groq prompt in `get_comprehensive_summary_from_groq()`:

```python
prompt = f"""
Your custom prompt here...
Focus on: {specific_areas_of_interest}
"""
```

### Discord Formatting

Customize Discord embeds in `format_for_discord()`:

```python
# Add custom fields
embed["fields"].append({
    "name": "Custom Field",
    "value": "Custom Value",
    "inline": True
})
```

## Migration from GitHub Actions

If migrating from the GitHub Actions version:

1. **Keep existing environment variables** - Most configuration carries over
2. **Remove workflow files** - Delete `.github/workflows/` if no longer needed
3. **Update webhook URL** - Point to your Flask server instead of repository dispatch
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify all functionality works as expected

## Support

For issues and questions:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review application logs for error details
3. Test with the `/test` endpoint for debugging
4. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
